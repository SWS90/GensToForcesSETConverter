# GensToForcesSETConverter
Converts object layout data from Sonic Generations to Sonic Forces. 
<br />Drag and drop any Sonic Generations .set.xml onto GensToForcesSETConverter.exe to get a gedit for use in Sonic Forces.
<br />
<br />Please note the following:
<br />Not every object that converts to Forces was tested.
<br />Whatever objects don't normally convert will be converted to Forces ObjGismo. A helpful .txt file will be created, listing the objects.
<br />The DirectX version of HedgeEdit is fully required to correctly load .gedits made by this tool.
<br />
<br />Object rotations will have 3 results:
<br />Will be correct.
<br />Will convert with wrong rotation.
<br />Will convert with 0,0,0
<br />
<br />Can't do anything about the last 2, it's simply the process of losing one axis of rotation and the math itself.
<br />
<br />Thanks to SuperSonic16 for the original code. 
<br />And to Skyth and Sajid for additional coding help, and to PTKickass for testing various versions of the tool.
